> Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return _its sum_.
A **subarray** is a **contiguous** part of an array.

> **Input:** nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
> <br>
**Output:** 6 <br>
**Explanation:** [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

The idea behind this problem is to find the longest subarray that results in the highest sum. When checking the sum of the subarray, we can check if the sum is negative. If it is negative and less than the current number, than we can reset our currentSum and have currentSum equal to the current number (since current number)

This algorithm will use [[Kadane's Algorithm]] to solve.

```C++

int maxSubArray(vector<int> & nums) {
	if (nums.size() == 1) return nums[0];
	int currentSubarray = nums[0];
	int maxSubarray = nums[0];
	
	// Start at 0 since we already have currentSubarray start a 0
	for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
		currentSubarray = max(nums[i], currentSubarray + nums[i]);
		maxSubarray = max(maxSubarray, currentSubarray);
	}
	
	return maxSubarray;

}

```

## Keep an eye on ->
``` C++
currentSubarray = max(nums[i], currentSubarray + nums[i]);
```

The idea is when our current subarray sum is negative, we want to start at a new subarray, since there is a chance that we are not increasing our sum (if we have a current -2, adding a 1 will still result in a negative number).

Thus we are restarting our currentSubarray at the current number in that situation.

## Key Takeaway
The key takeaway from this problem is the use of [[Dynamic Programming]], which is optimal when finding a maximum or minimum in a problem.
