> Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_. You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

## Initial Approach
My initial approach to solving this is to use a [[Hash Table]], as it is efficient in accessing data if we already know the key. The key we are using will be the current number in nums, and we will keep checking if that number exists in the hash table. If not, we insert into the table. If when looking in the hash table we find the number, we return true. Else, we return false.

```C++
class Solution {
	public:
		int containsDuplicate(vector<int> & nums) {
			unordered_map<int, int> uMap;
			for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
				if (uMap.find(nums[i]) != uMap.end()) // Found element
					return true;
				uMap[nums[i]] = i; // Value can be anything
			}
			return false;
		}
}



```
